Problem 1:
Write a program that counts how many unique words are in a string. Make sure that it prints in alphabetical order.
Input: Hello HELLO worlD WORld hi
Output:
Hello: 2
Hi: 1
World: 2
Problem 2:
For this example, assume a valid telephone number is 10 digits long. However, it cannot have the number 911 in any part of the phone number. In your program, have the user enter a phone number and tell them if it is a valid phone number or not WITHOUT USING REGEX. See below for what counts as valid inputs. Remember to check for inputs with correctly formatted parenthesis and dashes.
Valid:
0123456789
(012) 345-6789
012-345-6789
Not valid:
000911000
(111) 911-2084
911-911-0000
009-110-0000
Problem 3:
Create a Tic-tac-toe game. The game should accept two players and print a new board to the screen each time a player adds an X or O to the board. Once the game is complete and a winner is declared, give the option to restart the game.
